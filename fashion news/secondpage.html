            <span>I feel so unsure <br>
                As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor <br>
                As the music dies, something in your eyes <br>
                Calls to mind a silver screen <br>
                And all its sad good-byes <br>
                I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br>
                Though it's easy to pretend <br>
                I know you're not a fool <br>
                I should've known better than to cheat a friend <br>
                And waste the chance that I'd been given <br>
                So I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                The way I danced with you, oh <br>
                Time can never mend <br>
                The careless whispers of a good friend <br>
                To the heart and mind <br>
                Ignorance is kind <br>
                There's no comfort in the truth <br>
                Pain is all you'll find <br>
                I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br>
                Though it's easy to pretend <br>
                I know you're not a fool <br>
                I should've known better than to cheat a friend (should've known better, yeah) <br>
                And waste the chance that I'd been given <br>
                So I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                The way I danced with you, oh <br>
                Never without your love <br>
                Tonight the music seems so loud <br>
                I wish that we could lose this crowd <br>
                Maybe it's better this way <br>
                We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say <br>
                We could have been so good together <br>
                We could have lived this dance forever <br>
                But now, who's gonna dance with me? <br>
                Please stay <br>
                And I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br>
                Though it's easy to pretend <br>
                I know you're not a fool <br>
                I should've known better than to cheat a friend <br>
                And waste the chance that I'd been given <br>
                So I'm never gonna dance again <br>
                The way I danced with you, oh <br>
                now that you're gone <br>
                (Now that you're gone) was what I did so wrong, so wrong <br>
                That you had to leave me alone? <br>
